The purpose of LinuxChix is to support women in computing. At its narrowest, the scope of LinuxChix is to support women in Free and Open Source computing.
</p>

<p>
Methods of supporting women in computing include but are not limited to:
<p>

<ul>
<li>social support</li>
<li>sharing common experience</li>
<li>providing a space to vent</li>
<li>mentoring</li>
<li>networking</li>
<li>teaching</li>
<li>sharing technical skills</li>
<li>providing encouragement</li>
<li>identifying common problems</li>
</ul>

<p>
Technologies for doing this include but are not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>mailing lists</li>
<li>IRC</li>
<li>web pages</li>
<li>phone</li>
<li>ace to face meetings</li>
</ul>

<p>
Anything which does not support women in computing is outside the LinuxChix charter. This does not mean that these things are not worth doing, merely that they are not part of what LinuxChix is for.
